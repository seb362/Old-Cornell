## Contract Terms

**Your group contract/working agreement should include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

1. To what goals do we all commit?
We will get work in on time for deadlines and milestones.
We will try to answer as quickly as possible to online communication from other group members and from our client.
We will create a website that fits our client's needs.

2. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)
If something comes up and you can't make a meeting, be sure to message the group beforehand to let everyone know.
We'll let group members know what we're working on before we start working on it, to avoid doubling up on work and creating merge conflicts.
We'll keep code organized and readable, with many comments to help others read it.

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?
We will primarly communicate through our facebook chat. We're planning to meet at least once a week to discuss work on the project, and additional times if deemed necessary.

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?
We will communicate the client electronically for quick questions/ask for resources from them. We will also schedule in-person meetings with the client to recieve input on the website's look and get overall better communication.

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.
We won't have extremely well defined roles - we don't want members to feel like anyone is solely response for one part of the website and can't recieve help, if needed. Also, defining roles will probably result in a less even distribution of work (for example, doing the css for the website might be the most time intensive protion and we don't want that person to shoulder the majority of the work because of a relatively arbitrary decision made before the project). We expect each team member to make major contribution to the coding of the site. We'll likely have one person in charge of the database/database management, one person take a lead in login/logout functions and functionality, and the other two people will primarily focus on the content and design of the overall site.

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?
Hopefully, we won't run into this issue. If a team member is not doing their share of the work for a given milestone, we'll ask that they'll do more on future milestones. Worst case scenario, we'll work more in person to ensure that the group member is spending time on the project.

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?
For design decisions, we'll put it to a vote and go with the majority. For decisions about the physcial appearance or content of the site, our client will break ties. Otherwise, the person in charge of coding that segment will be in charge.

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?
We'll openly revist this contract if a dispute comes up that is not covered by this contract. If we find that a part of the contract is restricing our work, we'll also revisit.

10. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)
Pizza to celebrate milestones?

## How to Use This Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract. If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info2300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?"
