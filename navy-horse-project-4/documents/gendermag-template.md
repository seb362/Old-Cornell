**Task name: Request a Lion dance performace.**

[Add as many subgoals as you needs]
**Subgoal # 1 Navigate to the page needed to request a Lion dance performace**
	(e.g., "# 1 : Select the section of the document you want to print")

  - Will Abby have formed this sub-goal as a step to their overall goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: Yes
    - Why? There is no way to request a performance from the home screen. A person with a minimal amount of time searching the web would know about different paegs of a website, and would likely attempt to navigate to a page that could suit her goal

[Add as many actions as you need...]
**Action #1 Select performances.php link**

  - Will Abby know what to do at this step?
    - Yes, maybe or no: yes.
    - Why? (Especially consider Abby's Knowledge/Skills, Motivations/Strategies, Self-Efficacy and Tinkering.)
    Our navigation is well labeled enough such that there is not a logical other option. Assuming Abby would know to navigate to other pages, she would be able to select the correct page.

  - If Abby does the right thing, will she know that she did the right thing, and is making progress towards her goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: yes
    - Why? (Especially consider Abby's Self-Efficacy and Attitude toward Risk.)
      In this scenario, the page she would pull up would immediately show the form to request a lion dance performance. She would be able to see it and would know that she navigated to the correct page.

  **Subgoal 2: Do the form request.**
  Will Abby have formed this sub-goal as a step in their overall goal?

  Will Abby know what to do
  - Maybe, the form is intended designed to clearly be a form, with expected information on the form. However, our sketch currently does not display this. To rememdy this issue, we will iterate on the sketch desgin.
   Will she know whe did the right thing
  Maybe, the form is intended to have good, standard feedback upon submission. However, our design does not current desplay form feedback.

[Add as many actions as you need...]
**Action #1 Input information to fill out the form**
	(e.g., "# 1 : Put the mouse at the beginning of the section you want to print")

  - Will Abby know what to do at this step?
    - Yes, maybe or no: Yes
    - Why?  Seems like a very basic, intuitive step to filling out an online form.

  - If Abby does the right thing, will she know that she did the right thing, and is making progress towards her goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: Yes
    - Why? (Especially consider Abby's Self-Efficacy and Attitude toward Risk.)
      The form will hold information needed to fill out the form. Upon submission (the next step) she should recieve information about incorrectly filled out fields.

**Action #2 Submit the information**
  Will Abby know what to do
  - Yes, this step is also intuitive and common with most existing websites
  If Abby does the right thing, will she know she is making process towards her goal
  - Yes, there will be feedback letting her know that the form has been submitted.

**Task 2: Add an image to the gallery**
**Subgoal 1: Log in**
  Will Abby have formed this as a subgoal
  Maybe - the login form will appear directly on the home page. However it may not be intuitive that a user will be able to log in to edit certain pages and parts of the website. To remedy this, we plan on putting an explaination of what logging in gives users access to with the log in form.

  Action 1: log in
  - Will Abby know what to do at this step?
    - Yes, maybe or no: Yes
    - The site is designed to replicate common log in form structure

  - If Abby does the right thing, will she know that she did the right thing, and is making progress towards her goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: Yes
    - Why? Again, The form will hold information needed to fill out the form. Upon submission (the next step) she should recieve information about incorrectly filled out fields.

  **Subgoal 2: add an image**
    Action 1: click the upload link
    - Yes
    The upload link will replace the login information. The website text will make it clear that that is the wya to upload information

    Action 2: select image to be added to gallery
    - Yes
    Assuming she knows what image she wants to add, the upload system should be as simple as selecting the image from her computer

    Action 3: Verify the image is in the gallery
    - Maybe
    There will be a sucessfully uploaded response, but she would have to naviagate to the gallery and search through all the images to be 100% sure, if she doesn't "trust" the website feedback.
