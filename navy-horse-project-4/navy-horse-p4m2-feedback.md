# Project 4 Milestone 2 Grading Rubric

**Milestone 2 is graded out of 20 points and for completion.**

For Milestone 2, you should have developed a design and coding plan for your project based on the information you gathered in Milestone 1. This plan will make it easier for you to implement your project later on.


## Client Feedback & Design Iteration
- [x] Client feedback is documented in `design-journey.md` and does not appear to be fabricated.
- [x] Team used client feedback to iterate design.
- [x] Changes to the design are thoroughly documented.

> Do you have any concerns with the iterated design or client feedback?

  - N/A

## Cognitive Walkthrough
- [x] A list of scenarios/tasks for the cognitive walkthrough is included:
  - Tasks say _what_ the user _wants_ to do, **not** how to do it.
  - For Example: `Share a photograph of a dog and properly label it as such.`
- [x] Team conducted a cognitive walkthrough:
  - Persona choice is rationalized and explained.
  - Walkthrough is conducted for **2** tasks.
  - Cognitive walkthrough was conducted thoroughly and thoughtfully.
  - Evaluation stays true to the persona. No "I" methodology.
  - All questions are carefully answered for all subgoals and actions.
- [x] Cognitive walkthrough exposes design issues.
  - It is very rare to find a "perfect" design.
  - The cognitive walkthrough should have uncovered a handful of issues.
  - Failure to uncover issues, likely means the cognitive walkthrough was not properly conducted.

> What did the team do well? What needs improvement?

  - Nice job on your analyses of each of the actions. You may want to break some of your subgoals/actions down further (i.e. "input information to fill out the form"). This can help you identify core issues.


> Are there any issues with the cognitive walkthrough? Should the team redo it?

  - No glaring issues.


## Final Design
- [x] Final design is polished and ready for implementation.
- [x] Final sketches take into account information discovered through client feedback and cognitive walkthrough.

> Do the final sketches show a website that has the right level of complexity for this project?

  - Nice job showing your client feedback changes!

## Database & Pseudocode Planning
- [ ] The schema is organized and sufficient to implement the website.
- [ ] The database follows best practices and standard conventions.
- [x] Pseudocode for **each** page is included.
- [ ] Pseudocode is sufficiently detailed so that an outside person can implement the site.

> Do you have any concerns about the team's planning?

  - DB schema planning is insufficient. Make sure you are identifying foreign keys, constraints, etc.
  - Pseudocode for each page is included, but is not detailed enough. Mostly contains include statements. You should flesh this section out more.


## Draft Website
- [ ] There exists a draft website.
- [ ] Most of the HTML is complete on the draft website.
- [ ] Most of the CSS is complete on the draft website.

## Overall

- [ ] Milestone is thoroughly and completely done. Team is ready for Milestone 3.
- [ ] Is the overall scale and scope of the project of appropriate size. (not too big, not too small)

> Should the team be concerned with the overall progress of the project?

    - No, but team should work to catch up on implementation.

> Things that the team did well:

    - Great work on your final design and taking the client feedback into account! Good work on your Cognitive Walkthrough as well!


> Things that the team could improve upon:

    - You may want to take another look at your interactivity. Just a photo gallery and contact form will not be enough. We are looking for an extra level of complexity as compared to Project 3.
    - Draft website needs significant work.
    - Database planning needs significant work.
    - Site does not launch due to DB error.


## Total

_If submission is obviously incomplete, 0 points. If the submission is mostly complete (> 70%), 20 points._

**Total: ( 20 / 20 points )**
